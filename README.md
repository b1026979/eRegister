eRegister App
=============
This app is built as a part of my Web Architecture module Project with looking at web application development.
In this project, we are looking at MVC (Model View Controller) and in particular the investigating of domain modelling and web services.
To achieve this I used GitHub and Grails apps plus using command line in Debian 6.0 operating system.
The purpose of this project is to gather a portfolio toward exploring the aspects of MVC.

Electronic attendance registers for lectures
============================================
In this project, I introduce a web based register app. You can use this app to sign a registration sheet for a course session. As a result, the app can give you a list of students, the lecturer and the date of signed registration sheet for a particular class in three different formats HTML, XML and JSON.

Configuration
=============
To make this app I used Debian, Java7, MySQL, Grails and git.
You need to use an operating system command line to build and run this app.
Make sure you run the grails in the background.
Use the command : grails run-app
